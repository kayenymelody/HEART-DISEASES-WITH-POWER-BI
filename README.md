##INTRODUCTION
This is a Power BI project on the analysis of health related data collected from Hungarians living in Cleveland that aided the diagnosis of whether or not they had a heart disease.

##PROBLEM STATEMENT
-Does increasing age increase the likelihood of developing a heart disease?
-What sex is most likely to develop a heart disease?
-Can having elevated fasting blood glucose levels alone be associated with having a heart disease?
-Does having exercise angina with no other kind of chest pain indicate that one has a heart disease?

##SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
The following Power BI features were incorporated;
Calculated columns, quick measures, page navigation
