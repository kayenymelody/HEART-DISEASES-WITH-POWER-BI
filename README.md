##INTRODUCTION
This is a Power BI project on the analysis of health related data collected from Hungarians living in Cleveland that aided the diagnosis of whether or not they had a heart disease.

##PROBLEM STATEMENT
-Does increasing age increase the likelihood of developing a heart disease?
-What sex is most likely to develop a heart disease?
-Can having elevated fasting blood glucose levels alone be associated with having a heart disease?
-Does having exercise angina with no other kind of chest pain indicate that one has a heart disease?

##SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
The following Power BI features were incorporated;
Calculated columns, quick measures, page navigation

##DATA SOURCING

I got this dataset from kaggle, an online website containing datasets. It contains 1190 rows with 12 columns (age, sex, resting BP, chest pain, fasting blood glucose, resting ecg, maximum heart rate, exercise angina, old peak, ST slope and target)

##DATA TRANSFORMATION AND MODELING
This dataset was already cleaned. Using power query, values in each row were replaced since the dataset was coded. Data types were then changed to whatever was appropriate for each column. Data was filtered to get only that pertaining to those diagnosed with heart diseases. Data modeling was not done since it was only one table.

##ANALYSIS AND VISUALISATION

A total of two pages;
Page one
-629 of the 1190 people were diagnosed with a heart disease,559 of whom were male.
-The average age of people diagnosed with a heart disease was 56 years, an average cholesterol level of 191.37mg/dl which is below the 200mg/dl normal maximum cholesterol level and an average resting systolic blood pressure of 134.26mmHg which is higher than the 120mmHg normal maximum systolic blood pressure.
- Only 187 people diagnosed with a heart disease had a fasting blood glucose greater than 120mg/dl, 460 people had flat ST slopes with the rest having either upsloping or those downsloping, only 56 had either atypical angina or typical angina and 383 reported to having exercise angina.
